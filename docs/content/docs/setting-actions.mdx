import { APP_NAME } from '@/config/app';
import { EllipsisVertical, Wrench } from 'lucide-react';

Setting actions are accessible on the default app settings list page by clicking
the <span className="inline-flex">(<EllipsisVertical />)</span> icon.

## 1. Backups & Restore

When selecting `Export`, a dialog will appear displaying a `JSON` string encoded with `Base64`.
This string contains all currently saved user settings.

To import this value, you can simply paste the string in the `Import` dialog, which will restore
the exported settings.

## 2. Device Settings

Clicking the `Settings` entry here will open your device's settings application.

Additionally, there is a `Launcher` entry that takes you directly to the "Default Home App"
device settings page, which will allow you to select your desired launcher, e.g.

- {APP_NAME}
- One UI Home
- Nova Launcher
- Pixel Launcher

## 3. Help

This will open the Webview Kiosk Home Page:

- https://webviewkiosk.nktnet.uk

in your default browser application.

## 4. More
