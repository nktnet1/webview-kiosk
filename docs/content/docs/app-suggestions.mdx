import { APP_NAME } from '@/config/app'

## 1. App Lock

In case your device credentials is bypassed or compromised, you may
find it worthwide to add another protection layer for sensitive applications.

For example, using [App Lock](https://github.com/PranavPurwar/AppLock),
an Open Source Android App Locker & Privacy Guard.

## 2. FMD Android

In case the Kiosk device is lost or stolen, having a way to trace its location
("Find My Device") can prove useful.

Using [FMD Android](https://gitlab.com/fmd-foss/fmd-android), you can find your
device via SMS, instant messengers, or a web interface using
[FMD Server](https://gitlab.com/fmd-foss/fmd-server)
which you can either self-host or use the hosted server linked on the
[official site](https://fmd-foss.org).

FMD allows you to locate, ring, wipe and issue other commands to your device
when it's lost. It aims to be a secure open source alternative to
[Google's Find Hub](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.adm).

## 3. Stay Put

[Stay Put - Unplug Alert](https://codeberg.org/y20k/stayput) deters casual
theft by triggering a loud alarm if someone unplugs your device, and requires
biometrics or device credentials to "disarm" it.

This can be useful if you need to leave your Kiosk device temporarily unattended.

## 4. Termux

While {APP_NAME} supports uploading local HTML files to the Android Webview, for
web applications that heavily utilises JavaScript/routing, e.g. a single-page app
built with React or Angular, this may not suffice.

In these advanced use cases, we recommend installing an android terminal emulator
such as [Termux](https://github.com/termux/termux-app), which can be used to host
local web servers accessible at `http://localhost:<YOUR_PORT>`.

## 5. Shizuku

You can use [shizuku](https://github.com/RikkaApps/Shizuku) to run `adb` commands
(e.g. together with termux) to set Webview Kiosk as a Device Owner.

For more information, see the Device Owner section under [security](/docs/security).

## 6. Dhizuku

Android only allows for a single device owner application to be set.

With [Dhizuku](https://github.com/iamr0s/Dhizuku) you can share the device
owner privileges with {APP_NAME} together other applications such as
- [OwnDroid](https://github.com/BinTianqi/OwnDroid),
- [Hail](https://github.com/aistra0528/Hail)
- [Amarok Hider](https://github.com/deltazefiro/Amarok-Hider)
- [Alliance Shield](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rrivenllc.shieldx)

## 7. Local Send

[Local Send](https://github.com/localsend/localsend) is an open-source
cross-platform alternative to AirDrop

It allows you to securely share files, folders and messages with nearby
devices over your local network.

## 8. KDE Connect

[KDE Connect](https://kdeconnect.kde.org) lets you connect your desktop and
kiosk device over the same network.

This can be useful for copying settings or APKs to multiple devices, using your
desktop as a keyboard or mouse during setup, or triggering an alert tone to
find a misplaced kiosk tablet.

## 9. OwnDroid

[Owndroid](https://github.com/BinTianqi/OwnDroid) uses Android's DevicePolicyManager
API to manage your device. This is similar to Google's [android-testdpc](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-testdpc)
project, but with a more user-friendly UI and can run in various modes
(including [Shizuku](https://github.com/RikkaApps/Shizuku) and [Dhizuku](https://github.com/iamr0s/Dhizuku)).

Using OwnDroid, you can add Webview Kiosk to the allowlist of applications that can
utilise [Lock Task Mode](https://developer.android.com/work/dpc/dedicated-devices/lock-task-mode).
