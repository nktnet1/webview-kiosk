## 1. Settings Authentication Session

The settings page is locked using the device's biometrics or credentials (if set).

Once unlocked, it will not prompt for login for the next 5 minutes.
This persisting session duration reset each time a settings page is accessed.

When the device is locked, or the app is exited or placed in the background,
the authentication session will be revoked.

## 2. Default Launcher

By setting {APP_NAME} as the default launcher (home screen) app, any attempts to
leave the app will simply re-open it.

To do this, use the `Launcher` option in <Link href="/docs/setting-actions">Setting Actions</Link>.

## 3. App Pinning / Lock Task Mode

### 3.1. User-owned Devices

On regular user-owned devices, to improve security, enable **Ask for
PIN/pattern/password before unpinning** in your device settings.

On some devices, it may be shown as **Lock device when unpinning** or equivalent.

This setting is accessible by first finding **App Pinning**, then clicking
into the item (instead of the toggle/switch) to see additional options.

This will ensure that users cannot unpin (and thus unlock) the kiosk view without
the device first locking itself and requiring your biometrics or credentials.

For more on Android App Pinning, visit the following resources:

1. [Google Official Documentation](https://support.google.com/android/answer/9455138)
1. [Samsung Guide for Unpin Lock](https://www.samsung.com/sg/support/mobile-devices/pin-an-app-to-your-phone-screen-so-that-it-cant-be-closed)

### 3.2. Device Policy Controller

If you have access to your Device Policy Controller (DPC), or your MDM/EMM
has provided an interface to do so, it is recommended that you add {APP_NAME}
to the allowlist of apps for lock task packages.

This has the benefits of:

1. removing warnings and instructions when you "lock" the app (as it is no
   longer "screen pinning" like in user-owned devices)
1. stopping users from triggering the "unpin" action using gestures or holding
   the back and overview button, thus removing the side-effect of the device
   getting locked when users attempt to "unpin"

In this mode, the only way to unlock {APP_NAME} would be using a methods
provided in-app, which are always configurable and can be disabled. The
supported methods are currently:

1. Opening the Kiosk Control Panel by either
   - holding the back button
   - tapping the screen 10 times in quick succession at your configured region
     (e.g. Top Left quadrant)
1. Adding a custom unlock shortcut (requires a physical keyboard or
   a method of that sending key combinations, e.g. `CTRL+1`)

When using Google's [Android Test DPC](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-testdpc),
You can go to `Lock Task -> Manage lock task list` and enable {APP_NAME}.

When using [OwnDroid](https://github.com/BinTianqi/OwnDroid), go to
`System -> Lock Task Mode -> Applications` and add Webview Kiosk's package name,
which you can find in the [About Settings](/docs/settings/about).

Finally, if you are writing your own DPC, the kotlin code to achieve this would be:

```kt
val APP_PACKAGES = arrayOf(
  // Choose one depending on your installation method:
  "uk.nktnet.webviewkiosk",   // GitHub, F-Droid, IzzyOnDroid, etc
  "com.nktnet.webview_kiosk", // Aurora Store, Google Play Store
)

val dpm = context.getSystemService(Context.DEVICE_POLICY_SERVICE) as DevicePolicyManager
val adminName = getComponentName(context)
dpm.setLockTaskPackages(adminName, APP_PACKAGES)
```

For more information, see
[Android's official documentation](https://developer.android.com/work/dpc/dedicated-devices/lock-task-mode#allowlist_apps).

### 3.3. Device Owner

When set as the device owner, {APP_NAME} automatically adds itself to the
[allowlist for lock task packages](https://developer.android.com/work/dpc/dedicated-devices/lock-task-mode).

You can set or remove {APP_NAME} as the device owner using Android Debug Bridge (ADB) on a PC.

```sh
# Set Webview Kiosk as Device Owner
adb shell dpm set-device-owner uk.nktnet.webviewkiosk/.WebviewKioskAdminReceiver

# Set Webview Kiosk as Device Owner
adb shell dpm remove-active-admin uk.nktnet.webviewkiosk/.WebviewKioskAdminReceiver
```

Alternatively, you can use [Shizuku](https://github.com/RikkaApps/Shizuku) and
[Termux](https://github.com/termux/termux-app) to obtain direct ADB access on
your android device (thus skipping the PC requirement). Refer to
[GitHub Discussion #33](https://github.com/nktnet1/webview-kiosk/discussions/33#discussioncomment-14672999)
for a video demonstration.

{APP_NAME} also supports [Dhizuku](https://github.com/iamr0s/Dhizuku), a tool
that can share device owner permissions. If Dhizuku is installed, you will be
prompted to grant permission when the app launches.

## 4. Managed App Configurations

For fully managed (company-owned) devices, you can use
[managed configurations](https://developer.android.com/work/managed-configurations)
to restrict and remotely modify {APP_NAME} settings through your MDM/EMM.

It is also possible to set app restrictions using the
[Test DPC](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-testdpc) application
mentioned previously.

For a list of available app restrictions, refer to
[./app/src/main/res/xml/app_restrictions.xml](https://github.com/nktnet1/webview-kiosk/blob/main/app/src/main/res/xml/app_restrictions.xml).
