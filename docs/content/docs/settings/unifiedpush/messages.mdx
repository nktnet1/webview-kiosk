description: Data format for push message payload

import { APP_NAME } from '@/config/app';

{APP_NAME} push message payloads are similar to that of [MQTT](/docs/settings/mqtt).
However, all messages are sent to a single UnifiedPush endpoint instead of being
separated by topics.

A `type` property is used to differentiate between the different actions such
as `command` and `settings`.

## 1. Command

For additional options and the full list of supported commands, refer to
[MQTT -> Topics -> Command](/docs/settings/mqtt/topics/command#2-payloads).

Example Payload

```jsonc
{
  // Unique to UnifiedPush
  "type": "command",

  // Same as MQTT
  "command": "go_to_url",
  "data": {
    "url": "https://webviewkiosk.nktnet.uk"
  }
}
```

## 2. Settings

For additional options, refer to
[MQTT -> Topics -> Settings](/docs/settings/mqtt/topics/settings#2-payloads).

Example Payload

```jsonc
{
  // Unique to UnifiedPush
  "type": "settings",

  // Same as MQTT
  "data": {
    "settings": {
      "appearance.theme": "LIGHT"
    }
  }
}
```
