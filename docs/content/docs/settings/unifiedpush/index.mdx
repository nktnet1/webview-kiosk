import { APP_NAME } from '@/config/app';

## 1. Introduction

UnifiedPush is a decentralised push notification system designed to be
privacy-friendly, flexible, and open.
For more information, see the official documentation: https://unifiedpush.org

{APP_NAME} utilises UnifiedPush to enable you to remotely:

- update app settings
- perform actions via commands

## 2. Distributor

To use UnifiedPush with {APP_NAME}, you will need to choose a
[distributor](https://unifiedpush.org/users/distributors)
application, e.g.

- [ntfy-android](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy-android)
- [Sunup/android](https://codeberg.org/Sunup/android)

You will also need a push server, e.g. by self-hosting or using the public servers for:

- [ntfy](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy)
- [autopush-rs](https://github.com/p1gp1g/autopush-rs)

## 3. Debug Logs

UnifiedPush operations are recorded in the debug logs, which can be accessed
from the UnifiedPush settings screen.

This includes

- register/unregister
- message received
- new endpoint
- errors

A maximum of 100 messages will be stored for the duration of the app activity
lifecycle. The logs will not persist between app restarts.

## 4. Settings

### 4.1. Enabled

Allow {APP_NAME} to process new push messages or register new endpoints.

**Default:** false

### 4.2. Distributor

The package name of the [distributor](https://unifiedpush.org/users/distributors), e.g.

- io.heckel.ntfy
- org.unifiedpush.distributor.sunup

The distributor app serves as the middle-man that receives the app notification
from the push server and forwarding it to {APP_NAME}.

**Default:** (blank)

### 4.3. Instance

Registration instance. Can be used to create multiple registrations.

Supported variables:
- `APP_INSTANCE_ID`

Example:
- `wk-${APP_INSTANCE_ID}`

If left blank, `default` will be used.

**Default:** (blank)

### 4.4. Message for Distributor

A customised message that may be shown by the distributor UI to
identify this registration.

**Default:** (blank)

### 4.5. VAPID Public Key

VAPID public key (RFC8292), base64url, in uncompressed form (87 chars long).

For more details, see:
- https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8292

**Default:** (blank)

### 4.6. Process Unencrypted Messages

When enabled, {APP_NAME} will also handle UnifiedPush messages that
did not successfully decrypt.

A valid use case for this would be to for sending simple curl requests
to `ntfy.sh` without encryption for testing or convenience, although
this reduces security.

**Default:** false

### 4.7. Store Endpoint Credentials

When enabled, {APP_NAME} will persist the following values:

- Endpoint URL
- Endpoint Public Key
- Endpoint Auth Secret

Ideally, these values should not be stored at all, and are instead sent
directly to the application server at the point of registration.

However, {APP_NAME} does not yet have an application server. These values are
thus stored locally in the application so they can be copied. They can be
optionally redacted afterwards through the settings UI.

**Default:** true
