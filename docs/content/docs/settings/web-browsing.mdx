## 10. Allow Default Long Press

| Home | Navigates to the home page. |
| Refresh | Perform a reload on the current webpage. |
| Lock | Trigger either screen pinning or lock task mode depending on your device. |
| Unlock | Trigger screen unpinning or unlock task. Will require biometrics or device credentials to succeed. |

At the top-right corner of the dialog, there is an icon button that toggles the stickiness
