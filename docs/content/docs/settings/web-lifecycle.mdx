## 1. Lock on Launch

When enabled, the app will immediately enter locked/pinned mode
on startup, preventing exit until unpinned.

On some devices, you may still be prompted with a confirmation screen.

**Default:** false

## 2. Reset on Launch

When enabled, the app will always start fresh at the Home URL when
closed and re-opened, as opposed to the last visited URL.

The navigation history will also be cleared.

**Default:** false

## 3. Reset On Inactivity (seconds)

Number of seconds of inactivity before the app resets to the home URL.

When there is 5 seconds left, a warning countdown will be shown on
the screen.

The navigation history will be cleared when resetting.

To disable, use the value `0`.

**Minimum:** 10

**Default:** 0

## 4. Dim Screen On Inactivity (seconds)

Number of seconds of inactivity before the screen is dimmed (brightness = 0).

This will set the app brightness to 0, and will restore the brightness to
your `device -> brightness` setting upon new user interactions.

**Minimum:** 10

**Default:** 0

## 5. Refresh on Loading Error Interval (seconds)

Interval in seconds between automatic refresh attempts when a page fails
to load. This usually indicate the inability to connect to the server,
e.g. due to no internet connection or the server is offline.

This is detected using the Android API:
[WebViewClient#onReceivedError](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebViewClient#onReceivedError(android.webkit.WebView,%20android.webkit.WebResourceRequest,%20android.webkit.WebResourceError))
in conjunction with
[WebResourceRequest#isForMainFrame](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebResourceRequest#isForMainFrame()).

To disable, use the value `0`.

**Minimum:** 5

**Default:** 0
