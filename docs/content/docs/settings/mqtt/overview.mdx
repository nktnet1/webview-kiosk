### Introduction

Message Queueing Telemetry Transport ([MQTT](https://mqtt.org)) is a lightweight messaging protocol
for devices with limited resources. MQTT is built on top of TCP/IP and is ideal
for machine-to-machine communication and the Internet of Things (IoT).

{APP_NAME} utilises the MQTT protocol to enable you to remotely

- receive events
- update app settings
- perform actions via commands
- request information

### MQTT Broker

To communicate with {APP_NAME}, you will need an
[MQTT Broker](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-mqtt-broker-comparison).
The broker acts as an intermediary entity (central hub) that routes messages
between devices and applications.

Our recommendation for open source, self-hostable brokers (server) and clients
(to send messages to {APP_NAME}) are:

1. [EMQX](https://github.com/emqx/emqx) and [MQTTX](https://github.com/emqx/MQTTX) - specifically [MQTTX Web](https://github.com/emqx/MQTTX/tree/main/web)
1. [Eclipse Mosquitto](https://github.com/eclipse-mosquitto/mosquitto) and
   [Home Assistant](https://github.com/home-assistant) - see the
   [Integration Guide](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt)

There are also public brokers you can use for testing purposes, such as
- HiveMQ: https://www.mqtt-dashboard.com
- Mosquitto: https://test.mosquitto.org
- EMQX: https://www.emqx.com/en/mqtt/public-mqtt5-broker

### Global Variables

The following variables will be string-interpolated for supported settings,
such as topic names and will payload:

| Variable Name   | Description                             |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| APP_INSTANCE_ID | Unique identifier for the app instance. |
| USERNAME        | MQTT username used for authentication.  |

To use variables in your settings, use the syntax `${YOUR_VARIABLE}`, e.g.

```js
wk/${USERNAME}/${APP_INSTANCE_ID}/command
```

which may evaluate to a string such as

```txt
// [!code word:kiosk_user_01]
// [!code word:b8378168-ca69-11f0-af20-5a93ec0e6f90]
wk/kiosk_user_01/b8378168-ca69-11f0-af20-5a93ec0e6f90/command
```

Some settings will support additional variables.
