import { APP_NAME } from '@/config/app';

The settings below are modeled after HiveMQ client library's documentation for
[client configurations](https://hivemq.github.io/hivemq-mqtt-client/docs/client-configuration)
and
[mqtt operations -> connect](https://hivemq.github.io/hivemq-mqtt-client/docs/mqtt-operations/connect/#connect).

### 1. Server Host

The hostname or IP address of the MQTT broker the app should connect to.

For example,
- 192.168.1.190
- broker.hivemq.com
- broker.emqx.io

**Default:** 127.0.0.1

### 2. Server Port

The TCP port of the MQTT broker the app should connect to.

Typically,
- 1883 (TCP Port)
- 8883 (TLS TCP Port)

**Default:** 1883

### 3. Username

The username used to authenticate with the MQTT broker.

**Default:** (blank)

### 4. Password

The password used to authenticate with the MQTT broker.

**Default:** (blank)

### 5. Use TLS

When enabled, the client will connect securely to the broker
using TLS. Ensure the broker supports TLS on the configured port.

**Default:** false

### 6. Client ID

A unique identifier for this client when connecting to the MQTT broker.
Supports the variable APP_INSTANCE_ID, which you can use like:

```
wk-${APP_INSTANCE_ID}
```

If left blank, the server will create an identifier for the client.

**Default:** (blank)

### 7. Clean Start

When enabled, the MQTT client will start a new session on connect,
discarding any previous session state stored by the broker.

When disabled, the client will resume the previous session
(subscriptions, in-flight messages, etc.) if it exists.

**Default:** true

### 8. Keep Alive

The time interval (in seconds) in which the client sends a ping to the broker
if no other MQTT packets are sent during this period of time.

It is used to determine if the connection is still up.

**Default:** 60

### 9. Connect Timeout (seconds)

The timeout between sending the Connect and receiving the ConnAck message.

Use 0 to disable the timeout.

**Default:** 30

### 10. Socket Connect Timeout (seconds)

The timeout for connecting the socket to the server.

Use 0 to disable the timeout.

**Default:** 5

### 11. Automatic Reconnect

When enabled, attempt to automatically reconnect to the MQTT broker
after an unexpected disconnect.

In {APP_NAME}, this is implemented linearly at a fixed 3-second interval.

**Default:** true
