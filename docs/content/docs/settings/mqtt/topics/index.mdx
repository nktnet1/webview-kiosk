To understand MQTT's publish and subscribe architecture, refer to

* [EMQX — MQTT 5: Introduction to the Publish/Subscribe Model](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/mqtt-5-introduction-to-publish-subscribe-model)

### Quality of Service (QoS)

All topics in {APP_NAME} will allow the Quality of Service to be configured using one of:

| QoS | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| At most once (0) | The message is delivered at most once, with no acknowledgment. Delivery is not guaranteed. |
| At least once (1) | The message is delivered at least once. It may be delivered multiple times if acknowledgment is lost. |
| Exactly once (2) | The message is guaranteed to be delivered exactly once by using a two-step handshake between sender and receiver. |

The default is `At most once (0)`.

- [HiveMQ QoS Guide](https://www.hivemq.com/blog/mqtt-essentials-part-6-mqtt-quality-of-service-levels)

### Retained Messages

For publish topics, the `retain` property (type boolean) can be configured (default: false)

For subscribe topics, the `retained as published` property (type boolean) can be configured (default: false),
as well as:

| Retain Handling | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Send | The broker sends the retained message to the subscriber when it subscribes. |
| Send if Subscription Does not Exist | The broker sends the retained message only if the subscription is new and didn't exist before. |
| Do Not Send | The broker does not send any retained messages when the subscription is made. |

The default is `Do Not Send (2)`.

- [HiveMQ Retained Messages Guide](https://www.hivemq.com/blog/mqtt-essentials-part-8-retained-messages/)

### Request-Response Pattern

{APP_NAME} also utilises the request-response pattern for manual query
of device information states.

This pattern is explained in:

- [EMQX — MQTT 5: Request-Response](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/mqtt5-request-response)
- [HiveMQ — MQTT 5 Essentials Part 9: Request-Response Pattern](https://www.hivemq.com/blog/mqtt5-essentials-part9-request-response-pattern/)
