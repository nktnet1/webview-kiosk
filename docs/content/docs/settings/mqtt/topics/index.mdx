To understand MQTT's publish and subscribe architecture, refer to

* [EMQX — MQTT 5: Introduction to the Publish/Subscribe Model](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/mqtt-5-introduction-to-publish-subscribe-model)

## 1. Common Settings

### 1.1. Quality of Service (QoS)

All topics in {APP_NAME} will allow the Quality of Service to be configured using one of:

| QoS | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| At most once (0) | The message is delivered at most once, with no acknowledgment. Delivery is not guaranteed. |
| At least once (1) | The message is delivered at least once. It may be delivered multiple times if acknowledgment is lost. |
| Exactly once (2) | The message is guaranteed to be delivered exactly once by using a two-step handshake between sender and receiver. |

The default is `At most once (0)`.

For more information, see:

- [EMQX QoS Guide](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/introduction-to-mqtt-qos)
- [HiveMQ QoS Guide](https://www.hivemq.com/blog/mqtt-essentials-part-6-mqtt-quality-of-service-levels)

### 1.2. Retained Messages

For publish topics, the `retain` property (type boolean) can be configured (default: false)

For subscribe topics, the `retain as published` property (type boolean, default false) can be configured,
as well as `retain handling`, which can be:

| Retain Handling | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Send (0) | The broker sends the retained message to the subscriber when it subscribes. |
| Send if Subscription Does not Exist (1) | The broker sends the retained message only if the subscription is new and didn't exist before. |
| Do Not Send (2) | The broker does not send any retained messages when the subscription is made. |

The default `retain handling` is `Do Not Send (2)`.

- [HiveMQ Retained Messages Guide](https://www.hivemq.com/blog/mqtt-essentials-part-8-retained-messages/)

## 2. Shared Payload Properties

### 2.1. Message ID

For **published messages**, a
[UUID](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/UUID)
will be generated.

For **subscribed messages**, this can optionally be provided, which will appear in
the app's debug logs.

For response messages, the payload will contain a `requestMessageId`
if the `messageId` provided in the request.

Example in Payload:

```json
{
  "messageId": "e5e7cb82-cff4-11f0-a32b-5a93ec0e6f92"
}
```

### 2.2. App Instance ID

For **published messages**, the `appInstanceId`, which you can find
in the [Settings -> About](/docs/settings/about) screen, will be included
in each message, both in the payload and as a
[user property](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/mqtt5-user-properties).

Example in Payload:

```json
{
  "appInstanceId": "c345e39c-accd-11f0-9ea0-5a93ec0e6f91"
}
```

### 2.3. Username

For **published messages**, the MQTT connection `username` will be included
in each message, both in the payload and as a
[user property](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/mqtt5-user-properties).

Example in Payload:

```json
{
  "username": "test-user-001"
}
```
