## 2. Events

All published events will contain the
[shared payload properties](/docs/settings/mqtt/topics#2-shared-payload-properties)
mentioned previously, as well as an additional `eventType` property.

### 2.1. Connected

The `connected` event is published when {APP_NAME} has successfully connected
to your configured MQTT Broker.

Example payload:

```json
{
  "eventType": "connected",
  "messageId": "41576b3f-20ef-49a1-8793-afaa7d130514",
  "username": "medium-phone-api-35",
  "appInstanceId": "42188f0c-6784-4a52-95b6-8569f0f4d2f1",
  "data": {
    "currentUrl": "https://webviewkiosk.nktnet.uk",
    "lastInteractionTime": 1764689417653,
    "isLocked": false,
    "batteryPercentage": 62,
    "appBrightnessPercentage": -1,
    "systemBrightness": 255
  }
}
```

### 2.2. Disconnecting

The `disconnecting` event will be published just before the MQTT
connection will be halted.

The cause of disconnection will be included, and is one of:
- `USER_INITIATED_DISCONNECT`
- `USER_INITIATED_RESTART`
- `USER_INITIATED_SETTINGS_DISABLED`
- `SYSTEM_ACTIVITY_STOPPED,`
- `MQTT_RECONNECT_COMMAND_RECEIVED`

Example payload:

```json
{
  "eventType": "disconnecting",
  "messageId": "45dcd504-0795-467b-b58c-5afc5da31c17",
  "username": "medium-phone-api-35",
  "appInstanceId": "42188f0c-6784-4a52-95b6-8569f0f4d2f1",
  "data": {
    "cause": "SYSTEM_ACTIVITY_STOPPED"
  }
}
```

### 2.3. URL Changed

The `url_changed` event is sent each time a new page starts loading.

This is [debounced](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Debounce)
by 1 second, and will not be sent on app launch or refresh, as the URL did
not change.

Example Payload:

```json
{
  "eventType": "url_changed",
  "messageId": "b304f047-0e5b-4389-bcbc-3f9eb1ee4ec3",
  "username": "medium-phone-api-35",
  "appInstanceId": "42188f0c-6784-4a52-95b6-8569f0f4d2f1",
  "data": {
    "url": "https://webviewkiosk.nktnet.uk/docs/installation/"
  }
}
```

### 2.4. Lock

The `lock` event is triggered whenever the app enters Lock Task Mode
(or Screen Pinning for user-owned devices) from an unlocked state.

The `lockStateType` is passed as data, which can be one of:
- `LOCK_TASK`
- `SCREEN_PINNING`
- `UNKNOWN` (on Android 5.0)

Example payload:

```json
{
  "eventType": "lock",
  "messageId": "fada3acc-50aa-42dc-be96-681c295b8d4a",
  "username": "medium-phone-api-35",
  "appInstanceId": "42188f0c-6784-4a52-95b6-8569f0f4d2f1",
  "data": {
    "lockStateType": "LOCK_TASK"
  }
}
```

### 2.5. Unlock

The `unlock` event is triggered when the app exits Lock Task Mode
(or Screen Pinning for user-owned devices) from a locked state.

Example Payload:

```json
{
  "eventType": "unlock",
  "messageId": "74dd1313-88ed-48db-b707-5eda8c598e4d",
  "username": "medium-phone-api-35",
  "appInstanceId": "42188f0c-6784-4a52-95b6-8569f0f4d2f1"
}
```
