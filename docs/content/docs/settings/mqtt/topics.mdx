## Introduction

To understand MQTT's publish and subscribe architecture, refer to

- https://www.hivemq.com/blog/mqtt-essentials-part2-publish-subscribe

{APP_NAME} also utilises the request-response pattern for manual query
of device information states. This pattern is explained in:

## Publish

### Event Topic

The MQTT topic where event messages are published. Typically used for sending
real-time updates from the client to subscribers.

All global variables are supported, in addition to `EVENT_TYPE`.
For example, you can use:

```js
wk/${USERNAME}/${APP_INSTANCE_ID}/event/${EVENT_TYPE}
```

**Default:**

```js
wk/event/${EVENT_TYPE}
```

### Response Topic

**Default:** `wk/response/${RESPONSE_TYPE}`

## Subscribe

### Command Topic

**Default:** `wk/command`

### Settings Topic

**Default:** `wk/settings`

### Request Topic

**Default:** `wk/request`
