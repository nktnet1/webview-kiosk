description: Apply theme, desktop viewport, custom scripts
---

## 1. Apply App Theme

This option injects JavaScript that sets `prefers-color-scheme` according to
your selected Webview Kiosk theme.  
It keeps the webpage theme consistent with the app's theme.  

This script runs immediately **on page start**.

If the theme is the default **System**, this script is a no-op (does nothing).

**Default:** true

## 2. Apply Desktop Viewport Width (px)

This script injects JavaScript code that sets document.meta.content to
`width=YOUR_WIDTH_VALUE`, simulating web browsing on a Desktop.

JS history state changes will also be subscribed to (e.g. from Single Page
Applications), and the script will be re-triggered as needed.

You should only enable this option if setting the user agent was insufficient
to force Desktop mode, as the additional JS here will slow down the page.

You may also want to enable the following options under
`Settings -> Web Engine`:

- User Agent: Desktop
- Use Wide Viewport: `True`
- Load with Overview Mode: `True`
- Enable Zoom: `True`

To disable, use the value `0`.

**Minimum:** 640

**Default:** 0

## 3. Enable Battery API

When enabled, web pages can access device battery information through a JavaScript interface.

Web content can call `window.WebviewKioskBatteryInterface.getBatteryStatus()` to retrieve comprehensive battery data including:

- **Level and percentage** - Battery charge level as a decimal (0.0-1.0) and percentage (0-100)
- **Charging status** - Whether the device is currently charging
- **Charging type** - Method of charging: `none`, `usb`, `ac`, or `wireless`
- **Voltage** - Battery voltage in volts
- **Temperature** - Battery temperature in degrees Celsius
- **Health** - Battery health status: `good`, `overheat`, `dead`, `overvoltage`, `cold`, or `unknown`

### Example Usage

```javascript
try {
    const dataString = window.WebviewKioskBatteryInterface.getBatteryStatus();
    const battery = JSON.parse(dataString);

    console.log(`Level: ${battery.level}`);
    console.log(`Percentage: ${battery.percentage}%`);
    console.log(`Charging: ${battery.charging}`);
    console.log(`Charging Type: ${battery.chargingType}`);
    console.log(`Voltage: ${battery.voltage} V`);
    console.log(`Temperature: ${battery.temperature} °C`);
    console.log(`Health: ${battery.health}`);
} catch (error) {
    console.error("Failed to retrieve battery information:", error);
}
```

### Security Considerations

This feature exposes device information to web content. Only enable this setting
if your web application requires battery status information and you trust the
content being loaded.

**Default:** false

## 4. Custom Scripts

Your code content will be wrapped as follows to prevent polluting the global
scope and avoid conflicts with other scripts:

```javascript
(function() {
    // <YOUR CODE>
})()
```

**Example:**

```javascript
document.body.style.backgroundColor = 'green';
```

### 4.1. On Page Start

JavaScript to run immediately when the page starts loading.

Useful for early DOM manipulation or overriding functions.

**Default:** *(blank)*

### 4.2. On Page Finish

JavaScript to run after the page has fully loaded.  

Useful for DOM updates, styling, or injecting behavior.

**Default:** *(blank)*
