import { APP_NAME } from '@/config/app'

## 1. Keep Screen On

Enable this option to keep your device awake (no screen timeout).

Useful if you have a kiosk application that should always remain active.

**Default:** false

## 2. Rotation

Select one of:

| Option | Orientation        | Description |
|--------|--------------------|-------------|
| Auto   | `unspecified`      | No preference specified: let the system decide the best orientation. |
| 0°     | `portrait`         | Would like to have the screen in a portrait orientation: display taller than wide, ignoring sensor data. |
| 90°    | `landscape`        | Would like to have the screen in a landscape orientation: display wider than tall, ignoring sensor data. |
| 180°   | `reversePortrait`  | Would like to have the screen in portrait orientation, turned in the opposite direction from normal portrait. |
| 270°   | `reverseLandscape` | Would like to have the screen in landscape orientation, turned in the opposite direction from normal landscape. |

For more details, refer to Android's official documentation for [R.attr.screenOrientation](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr#screenOrientation).

**Default:** Auto

## 3. Brightness

Set the app window brightness from 0 (very dim) to 100 (very dark).

Use -1 to disable (i.e. the system default brightness will be used).

**Default:** -1

## 4. Allow Camera

Set to true to give WebView access to your device's camera.

You will need to grant the [CAMERA](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#CAMERA)
permission, which is required for the WebView's
[RESOURCE_VIDEO_CAPTURE](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/PermissionRequest#RESOURCE_VIDEO_CAPTURE)
feature.

**Default:** false

## 5. Allow Microphone

Set to true to give WebView access to your device's microphone.

You will need to grant the
[RECORD_AUDIO](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#RECORD_AUDIO)
permission, which is required for the WebView's
[RESOURCE_AUDIO_CAPTURE](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/PermissionRequest#RESOURCE_AUDIO_CAPTURE)
feature.

**Default:** false

## 6. Allow Location

When enabled, websites can request the device's location.

You can choose to request precise location (FINE) or approximate location (COARSE).

For more information, refer to
[location/permissions#accuracy](https://developer.android.com/develop/sensors-and-location/location/permissions#accuracy).

You will need to grant either
[ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION)
or
[ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION),
required for the WebView's
[GeolocationPermissions](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/GeolocationPermissions).

**Default:** false

## 7. Back Button Hold Action

Customise the behaviour when the back button is held down (long pressed).

| Option                     | Description |
|----------------------------|-------------|
| `OPEN_KIOSK_CONTROL_PANEL` | See `Web Browsing -> Kiosk Control Panel Region` for more details. |
| `GO_HOME`                  | Navigates to the Home Screen. |
| `DISABLED`                 | Do nothing (ignore long-press). |

**Default:** Open Kiosk Control Panel

## 8. Custom Unlock Shortcut

Provide a custom keyboard shortcut using a modifier key (CTRL/SHIFT/ALT/META)
in combination with another standard key to unlock/unpin the application.

For example, `CTRL+1`.

This is useful for devices with no navigation buttons on screen and instead
has a physical keyboard connected.

Please note that the shortcut will only trigger when there is no app-specific
dropdown/alerts opened (e.g. from floating toolbar, address bar or "go home"
confirmation dialog from multitap).

**Default:** *(blank)*

## 9. Custom Auth Password

Specify a custom password to protect your settings or when unlocking from
the kiosk state.

For user-owned devices that utilises screen pinning, this will only work
if you are using an unlock method provided by the app.

Device-level unpin methods (e.g. gestures/holding overview + back button
simultaneously) will bypass this setting. To enhance security, please
refer to the [security](/docs/security) documentation.

Leave this setting blank to use your device's biometrics or credentials.

**Default:** *(blank)*

## 10. Unlock Auth Requirement

This setting only applies to in-app unlock methods, e.g. when unlocking
using `Kiosk Control Panel` or `Custom Unlock Shortcut`.

| Option   | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Default  | Require authentication for lock task mode (device owner, fully-managed/company-owned devices), off for screen pinning (user-owned devices). |
| Off      | Unlock without requiring authentication. |
| Require  | Prompt for biometrics or device credentials when unlocking. |

For user-owned devices without lock task mode, the device will auto-lock when
unpinning, which is outside the control of {APP_NAME}.

**Default:** Default

## 11. Device Owner

For more information about `Device Owner`, see the [Security](/docs/security) documentation.
