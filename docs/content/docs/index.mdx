Webview Kiosk is a free and open-source Android application for secure,
kiosk-style web browsing.

It can function as digital signage, a kid-friendly restricted browser, an
immersive web reader, an interactive signup form, a home assistant dashboard,
or simply a wall clock.

Designed for small businesses and device owners who are looking for a simple
and standalone Kiosk solution.

## Key Features

- **Lock Task Mode (Pin):** prevent access to your device's home screen, apps and status bar
- **Secure Settings:** configurations are protected by biometrics, device credentials or custom password
- **URL Filtering:** use regular expression to control web access through blacklisting and whitelisting
- **Export/Import:** allows for the backup and restore of user settings and configurations
- **Local files:** display an image, audio, video, or HTML file in kiosk mode from your device
- **Managed Configurations:** for fully-managed (company-owned) devices, settings can be set
  and restricted remotely through an MDM/EMM provider

For all configurable settings, view the `Settings` section.
