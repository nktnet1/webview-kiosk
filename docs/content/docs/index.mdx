Webview Kiosk is a free and open-source Android application for secure,
kiosk-style web browsing.

It can function as digital signage, a kid-friendly restricted browser, an
immersive web reader, an interactive signup form, a home assistant dashboard,
or simply a wall clock.

Designed for small businesses and device owners who are looking for a simple
and standalone Kiosk solution.

## 1. Features

### 1.1. Core / Standalone

- <b>Lock Task Mode (Pin):</b> prevent access to your device's home screen, apps and status bar
- <b>Secure Settings:</b> configurations are protected by biometrics, device credentials or custom password
- <b>URL Filtering:</b> use regular expressions to control web access through a URL blacklist and whitelist
- <b>Export/Import:</b> backup and restore user settings in Base64 or JSON format
- <b>Local files:</b> display an image, audio, video, or HTML file in kiosk mode from your device
- <b>Default Launcher:</b> functions as a home app that and can launch other apps

### 1.2. Remote Management / Enterprise

- <b>Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT)</b>
  - Monitor events, update settings, execute commands and build custom
    automations using the API
  - Requires an MQTT broker (e.g. Mosquitto, EMQX or HiveMQ)
- <b>Managed Configurations (App Restrictions)</b>
  - For fully-managed (company-owned) devices, settings can be remotely
    configured via an MDM/EMM provider
  - Advanced users using a device policy controller (e.g. Test DPC or OwnDroid)
    can also enforce configurations locally

## 2. Additional Permissions

The Android permissions below are <b>optional</b> and their corresponding features
are <b>disabled in the app settings by default</b>:

- CAMERA
- RECORD_AUDIO
- ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION
- ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION

Only enable them if they are needed by your website or web application.
These permissions will not be used for any other purpose.

In addition, the <b>QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES</b> permission is used for:

1. Launching other apps, which can be helpful if {APP_NAME} set as the default launcher
2. Transferring device ownership to another admin receiver (e.g. [OwnDroid](https://github.com/BinTianqi/OwnDroid) or [Dhizuku](https://github.com/iamr0s/Dhizuku))
