## 1. Google Play

<Callout title="Automatic Protection Disabled" type="success">

From [v0.17.0](https://github.com/nktnet1/webview-kiosk/releases/tag/v0.17.0),
Google Play's [automatic protection](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10183279)
has been intentionally **disabled** to allow installations from the Aurora Store
([context](https://gitlab.com/AuroraOSS/AuroraStore/-/issues/1088)).

</Callout>

  />
</a>

While the app is available on the Google Play Store, <u>**we strongly recommend
that you install from Obtainium, F-Droid or IzzyOnDroid instead**</u> for
faster updates, enhanced privacy and a stronger assurance that the APK was built
directly from the source code.

### 1.1. Aurora Store

You can use the [Aurora Store](https://auroraoss.com/aurora-store),
a FOSS client for Google Play that works without needing Google Play Services or MicroG,
starting from [v0.17.0](https://github.com/nktnet1/webview-kiosk/releases/tag/v0.17.0).

While installation methods with reproducible builds and no involvement from Google is
preferred, this method still provides better privacy than using the Google Play Store.

## 2. GitHub

<Callout title="NOTE">
  As of [v0.15.7](https://github.com/nktnet1/webview-kiosk/releases/tag/v0.15.7),
  the package name has changed from `com.nktnet.webview_kiosk` to `uk.nktnet.webviewkiosk`
  for all installation sources except for the Google Play Store and its derivatives.
</Callout>

<a
  href={urlJoin(GITHUB_URL, 'releases')}
  target="_blank"
>
  <img
    src="/static/images/badges/github.png"
    alt="Get it on IzzyOnDroid"
    className="w-full max-w-48"
  />
</a>

Signed APKs are available for download on the
<a href={urlJoin(GITHUB_URL, 'releases')} target="_blank">GitHub Releases</a> page.

To build the application from source, clone the <a href={GITHUB_URL} target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>, open
the project in Android Studio and follow the [official documentation](https://developer.android.com/studio/run).

### 2.1. Obtainium

<a
  href="https://apps.obtainium.imranr.dev/redirect?r=obtainium://add/https://github.com/nktnet1/webview-kiosk"
  target="_blank"
>
  <img
    src="/static/images/badges/obtainium.png"
    alt="Get it on Obtainium"
    className="w-full max-w-48"
  />
</a>

[Obtainium](https://obtainium.imranr.dev) can be used to manage
installations and updates of {APP_NAME} on GitHub release page,
with the added bonus of notifications when new releases are made
available.

### 2.2. F-Droid

<a
  href="https://f-droid.org/packages/uk.nktnet.webviewkiosk"
  target="_blank"
>
  <img
    src="/static/images/badges/f-droid.svg"
    alt="Get it on F-Droid"
    className="w-full max-w-48"
  />
</a>

With [F-Droid reproducible builds](https://f-droid.org/docs/Reproducible_Builds)
enabled, F-Droid will publish the same APK as the GitHub releases after confirming
that it was generated from the same source code.

### 2.3. IzzyOnDroid

<a
  href="https://apt.izzysoft.de/fdroid/index/apk/uk.nktnet.webviewkiosk"
  target="_blank"
>
  <img
    src="/static/images/badges/izzy-on-droid.svg"
    alt="Get it on IzzyOnDroid"
    className="w-full max-w-48"
  />
</a>

Similar to F-Droid, the
[IzzyOnDroid reproducible builds](https://android.izzysoft.de/articles/named/iod-rbs-mirrors-clients)
criteria is also met.
