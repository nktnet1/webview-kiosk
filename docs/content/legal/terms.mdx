## Terms & Conditions

These terms and conditions apply to the {APP_NAME} app (hereby referred to
as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by Khiet Tam Nguyen
(hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as an Open Source service licensed
under the **GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL) v3 or later**.

Upon downloading or utilising the Application, you are automatically agreeing
to the following terms. A copy of the full AGPL v3 license is available at
https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html.
You are free to use, copy, modify, and distribute the Application under the
terms of this licence.

The Service Provider provides the Application “as is” and does not assume
responsibility for your use of the Application, including any data or network
interactions. The Application stores and processes personal data that you
have provided in order to provide the Service. It is your responsibility to
maintain the security of your phone and access to the Application. The Service
Provider strongly advises against jailbreaking or rooting your phone, which
may compromise your device security or the Application's functionality.

Please be aware that certain functions of the Application require an active
internet connection. The Service Provider cannot be held responsible if the
Application does not function at full capacity due to lack of Wi-Fi or if you
have exhausted your data allowance. You are responsible for any charges
incurred by your mobile provider, including roaming data charges if you use
the Application outside of your home region.

Similarly, the Service Provider cannot assume responsibility for your device
status, such as keeping it charged. If your device runs out of battery and
you cannot access the Service, the Service Provider cannot be held responsible.

While the Service Provider strives to keep the Application updated and
accurate, they rely on third parties for some information and accept no
liability for any loss resulting from reliance on the Application's functionality.

The Service Provider may update or cease distributing the Application at any
time. However, for versions of the Application released under the AGPL v3, the
rights and licenses granted to users will continue in perpetuity. You may
continue to use, modify, and redistribute those versions in accordance with the
terms of the AGPL v3.

**Disclaimer:** The Application optionally passes permissions and information
to the Android WebView if granted. The Service Provider is not responsible for
how websites accessed through the WebView handle or use this data.

### Changes to These Terms and Conditions

The Service Provider may periodically update their Terms and Conditions. You
are advised to review this page regularly for any changes. Notifications of
updates will be posted on this page.

These terms and conditions are effective as of 2025-12-03.
