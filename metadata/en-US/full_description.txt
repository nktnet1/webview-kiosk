Webview Kiosk is a free and open-source Android application for secure, kiosk-style web browsing.

It can function as digital signage, a kid-friendly restricted browser, an immersive web reader, an interactive signup form, a home assistant dashboard, or simply a wall clock.

Designed for small businesses and device owners who are looking for a simple and standalone Kiosk solution.

### Key Features

- <b>Lock Task Mode (Pin):</b> prevent access to your device's home screen, apps and status bar
- <b>Secure Settings:</b> configurations are protected by biometrics, device credentials or custom password

- <b>Export/Import:</b> allows for the backup and restore of user settings and configurations

### 2. Additional Permissions

The Android permissions below are <b>optional</b> and their corresponding features are <b>disabled in the app settings by default</b>:

- CAMERA
- RECORD_AUDIO
- ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION
- ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION

Only enable them if they are needed by your website or web application. These permissions will not be used for any other purpose.

In addition, the <b>QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES</b> permission is used for:

1. Launching other apps, which can be helpful if Webview Kiosk set as the default launcher
2. Transferring device ownership to another admin receiver (e.g. [OwnDroid](https://github.com/BinTianqi/OwnDroid) or [Dhizuku](https://github.com/iamr0s/Dhizuku))
