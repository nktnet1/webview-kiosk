Webview Kiosk is a free and open-source Android application for secure, kiosk-style web browsing.

It can function as digital signage, a kid-friendly restricted browser, an immersive web reader, an interactive sign-up form, a home assistant dashboard, or simply a wall clock.

Designed for small businesses and device owners who are looking for a simple and standalone Kiosk solution.

<big>Key Features</big>

<b>Core / Standalone</b>

- <b>Lock Task Mode (Pin):</b> prevent access to your device's home screen, apps and status bar
- <b>Secure Settings:</b> configurations are protected by biometrics, device credentials or custom password
- <b>URL Filtering:</b> use regular expressions to control web access through a URL blacklist and whitelist
- <b>Export/Import:</b> backup and restore user settings in Base64 or JSON format
- <b>Local files:</b> display an image, audio, video, or HTML file in kiosk mode from your device
- <b>Default Launcher:</b> use as the home app and launch other apps in lock task mode (kiosk)

<b>Remote Management / Enterprise</b>

1. MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport)

    - Monitor events, update settings, execute commands and build custom automations using the API
    - Requires an MQTT broker (e.g. Mosquitto, EMQX, HiveMQ)

2. UnifiedPush

    - Send commands and update settings via a decentralised push notification system
    - Requires a distributor application (e.g. sunup, ntfy)

3. Managed Configurations (App Restrictions)

    - For fully-managed (company-owned) devices, settings can be remotely configured via an MDM/EMM provider
    - Advanced users using a device policy controller (e.g. Test DPC or OwnDroid) can also enforce configurations locally
