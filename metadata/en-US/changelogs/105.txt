## MQTT

Adds support for Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT), which can be used to remotely:
- monitor events (e.g. url change, kiosk lock/unlock)
- update settings & configurations
- execute commands (e.g. refresh, go home, search)
- build automations using the API

To use this feature, you will need an MQTT broker, e.g. Mosquitto, EMQX or HiveMQ.
