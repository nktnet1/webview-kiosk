> Web Browsing -> Override Url Loading Block Action

Action to take when a URL navigation (via shouldOverrideUrlLoading) matches the blacklist regex.

Typically, this is from clicking links (`<a>` tags) on a webpage's HTML.

Actions are:
- Show Block Page (display a HTML block page)
- Prevent Navigation (does nothing when links are clicked)
- Show Toast (shows a toast with your custom block message)

This option will NOT take effect for:

- JavaScript navigation
- Custom URL loading, e.g. from the Address Bar, Bookmarks, History, etc

In those other cases, the block page will simply be shown.

**Default:** Show Block Page
