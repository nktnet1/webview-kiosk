## Changes

The action buttons in the
- Address Bar
- Kiosk Control Panel

Can now be configured (i.e. remove or rearrange).

This is only for the UI - their respective access settings will still
need to be enabled for the action buttons to be visible.

Additionally, the custom unlock shortcut and user interactions
(e.g. touching the screen) will now be detected even when dialogs
and dropdowns are opened.
