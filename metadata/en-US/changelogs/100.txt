## New Features

- feat: prevent screenshots, screen recordings, recents app preview (device -> prevent screen capture)
- feat: launch other apps (configurable as an action in the address bar or kiosk control panel)
- feat: ability to transfer device owner
- feat: more setting actions - shortcuts (e.g. to WiFi, Data, Default Apps)

## New Permission

The QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES permission is requested for:

1. Launching other apps, which can be helpful if Webview Kiosk set as the default launcher
2. Transferring device ownership to another admin receiver (e.g. OwnDroid or Dhizuku)

## Bug Fixes

- fix: dhizuku permission lost due to upstream false negative bug (issue 205)
- fix: require auth on resume of activity
- fix: webview inset option casing (potentially reset preference)
- fix: default for address bar size - MEDIUM
