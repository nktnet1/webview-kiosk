## New Feature

> Appearance -> Floating Toolbar Mode

Control the visibility and behaviour of the floating toolbar menu button:

1. Hidden  
2. Hidden when locked  
3. Shown  

When set to **Hidden**, the "Settings" button will be available from the Kiosk Control Panel.

Additionally, when set to **Hidden**, if both of the following are true:

1. `Web Browsing -> Kiosk Control Panel Region` is disabled
2. `Device -> Back Button Hold Action` is not set to "Open Kiosk Control Panel"

Then the `Web Browsing -> Kiosk Control Panel Region` cannot be disabled and will default to `Top Left`.

**Default:** Hidden when locked
