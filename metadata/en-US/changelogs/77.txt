## Changes

New Setting (feature):
> `Web Lifecycle -> Refresh on Loading Error Interval (seconds)`

Interval in seconds between automatic refresh attempts when a page fails
to load. This usually indicate the inability to connect to the server,
e.g. due to no internet connection or the server is offline.

The setting is disabled by default (value 0).
