## UnifiedPush

Adds support for UnifiedPush, a decentralised push notification system designed to be privacy-friendly, flexible, and open.

Similar to MQTT, this can be used to remotely:

- perform actions via commands
- update the app settings

To use this feature, you will need a distributor application such as sunup or ntfy.
